# Raster Grid Application

A React and TypeScript application with a static image and an interactive raster grid overlay. The application provides a fixed set of cells that users can interact with by hovering and clicking to control visibility.

## Features

- **Static Image Display**: Displays a predefined static image as a background.
- **Fixed Raster Definition**: Defines a grid with six cells labeled "Cell 1" to "Cell 6".
- **List View for Cells**: Shows cell names in a vertical list on the left, with checkbox for visibility control.
- **Interactivity**:
  - **Hover Functionality**: Hovering over a cell name highlights the corresponding cell on the image by changing its border color.
  - **Click Functionality**: Clicking on a cell name toggles the cellâ€™s visibility on the image.
